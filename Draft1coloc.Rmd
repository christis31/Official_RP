## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

```{r}
#Install packages
if("librarian" %in% installed.packages()==FALSE) install.packages("librarian")
if (!require("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
  install.packages("BiocManager")
BiocManager::install(version = "3.20")
librarian::shelf(tidyverse, purrr, BiocManager, AnnotationDbi, 
                 qvalue, GO.db, org.Hs.eg.db, reshape2, UniProt.ws, biomaRt)
```


Download CAD-associated variants from Aragam et al., 2022 and UKB-PPP

```{r}
cad <- as.data.frame(read.csv(".\\data\\raw\\CAD_GWAS.csv"))
pqtl <- as.data.frame(read.csv(".\\data\\raw\\pQTL_discovery.csv"))

#filter the data to include only trans-pqtls OR cis/pqtls
trans <- pqtl %>%
  filter(cis.trans == "trans") #12332 trans-pqtls, 86.31% of observations are trans

cis <- pqtl %>%
  filter(cis.trans == "cis") #1955 cis-pqtls, 13.79%
```

Check for overlap between genes associated with CAD and Bioinformatics.annotated genes where pQTLs coulld be located

```{r}

#all pqtls
pqtl_gene <- unique(pqtl$Bioinfomatic.annotated.gene)
length(pqtl_gene) #3763 genes involved in affecting plasma proteins

#cis
cis_gene <- unique(cis$Bioinfomatic.annotated.gene)
length(cis_gene) #1698 genes involved in affecting plasma proteins in cus

#trans
trans_gene <- unique(trans$Bioinfomatic.annotated.gene)
length(trans_gene) #2434 genes involved in affecting plasma proteins in trans

cad_genes <- unique(cad$Nearest_gene)
length(cad_genes) #216 genes 

#overlap between trans and cis genes
length(intersect(cis_gene, trans_gene)) #369 genes dispaly variants which affect proteins in both cis and trans
length(intersect(cad_genes, pqtl_gene)) #79 genes who are found to be associated with CAD where also associated with pqtls

length(intersect(cad_genes, cis_gene)) #26 in cis
length(intersect(cad_genes, trans_gene)) #70 in trans
```
Display a table showing the overlap between pqtls and CAD variant genes and whether they act in cis or trans
```{r}
#make a table

common_trans_cad <- intersect(cad_genes, trans_gene)
common_cis_cad <- intersect(cad_genes, cis_gene)
cis_cad_overlap <- common_pqtl_cad %in% common_cis_cad
trans_cad_overlap <- common_pqtl_cad  %in% common_trans_cad

#Labelling
regulation_cad_type <- ifelse(cis_cad_overlap & trans_cad_overlap, "Both",
                          ifelse(cis_cad_overlap, "Cis",
                                 ifelse(trans_cad_overlap, "Trans", "None")))

overlap_cad_pqtl_table <- data.frame(
  Gene =  intersect(cad_genes, pqtl_gene),
  regulation_cad_type
)

print(overlap_cad_pqtl_table)
```

Check overlap with enzyme an lectin genes too 
```{r}
#enzymes
#Load data
data_filt_glyenz <- read.csv("./data\\processed\\data_filt_glyenz.csv")

#Select enzyme gene
enzgenes <- unique (data_filt_glyenz$enz_gene)
length(enzgenes) #103 unique enzgyme genes involved in glycosylation

####
#Should i do and for any enzyme gene?
##

#overlap with cad
common_glyenz_cad_genes <- intersect(cad_genes, enzgenes)
length(common_glyenz_cad_genes) #2 genes, ABO and ST3GAL4

overlap_cad_enz_table <- data.frame(
  Gene = common_glyenz_cad_genes 
)

print(overlap_cad_enz_table)

#lectins
#load data
all_lectins <- read_tsv("./data\\raw\\glyco\\human_lectins.tsv")

#extract lectin genes
all_lectin_genes <- unique(all_lectins$`HGNC gene name`)
length(all_lectin_genes) #214 genes 

#overlap with cad
common_cad_lectin_genes <- intersect(cad_genes, all_lectin_genes)
length(common_cad_lectin_genes) #1 gene ANGPTL4


overlap_cad_lectin_table <- data.frame(
  Gene = common_cad_lectin_genes
)

print(overlap_cad_lectin_table)
```


Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
